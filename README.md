# Bike Sales Performance Tracker Project
# 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains my implementation of data cleaning and dashboard creation using Excel. In this project, I cleaned and organized a messy dataset by using nested IF formulas to handle errors, removing duplicates, and correcting formatting inconsistencies. I set up dynamic ranges and Excel Tables for automatic updates. To improve data exploration, I created Pivot Tables with slicers and timelines for easy filtering. I also developed an interactive dashboard featuring bar, line, and pie charts that update based on user selections. Additionally, I applied conditional formatting and data validation to highlight key figures and reduce errors, resulting in a faster, more efficient process and an intuitive tool for insightful decision-making.

# 📊 Project Walkthrough

# 1. Data Collection & Organization

This working sheet is the main place where all sales data is collected and organized. It helps track sales numbers, identify trends, and supports smooth functioning of the sales dashboard. By gathering raw data here, the sheet makes it easier to update and analyze sales performance. To ensure accuracy, all data entries are double-checked against original sources. The sheet’s structure and built-in calculations help quickly spot important insights and keep the sales tracking process efficient and reliable.

# 2. Creating the Pivot Table

Using the cleaned dataset, I created a Pivot Table to start visualizing the data. I selected the data range carefully, using the unique ‘ID’ field as the key identifier. Absolute cell references (with $) were applied to lock ranges for consistent formula use. The Pivot Table was inserted either in a new or existing worksheet depending on layout needs.

# 3. Configuring Pivot Table Fields

In the PivotTable Fields pane, I picked the important fields and placed them into Filters, Columns, Rows, or Values. This helped me organize the data just the way I wanted. It made the summary clear and easy to understand, and I could easily change the layout to focus on different parts when needed.

# 4. Summarizing Data with PivotTable

After selecting the fields, the raw data was transformed into a clean, summarized table that clearly shows the key information. This organized layout made it much easier to analyze the data from various perspectives by rearranging the fields as needed. It also helped me quickly spot trends and patterns, making the whole analysis process more efficient and insightful.

# 5. Advanced PivotTables & Analysis

I built 3 PivotTables to deepen my data analysis, using sorting, filtering, and grouping to organize the information effectively. By trying different ways of placing fields, I was able to discover important patterns and connections within the data. This process not only improved my understanding but also strengthened my ability to present clear and compelling insights.

# 6. Interactive Dashboard & Slicers
<img width="1366" height="510" alt="Final Dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae9bfc3b-005b-4209-92db-0bc09731f91e" /> 
The last step was putting the charts together into an interactive dashboard with slicers for Marital Status, Education, and ID. These slicers let users filter the data on the fly, so all the charts and PivotTables update right away. This makes the dashboard easy to use and helps people quickly explore and compare sales data from different angles.

# 📝 Conclusion
This project shows how I can clean up, organize, and analyze data using Excel’s PivotTables and dashboards. It helped me get better at handling complex data and turning it into clear insights. I also learned how to make visuals that really explain the data well. Creating interactive dashboards with filters made it easy for users to explore the info and make smart decisions. Overall, working on this boosted my confidence in sharing and understanding data.
